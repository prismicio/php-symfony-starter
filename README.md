## Starter for Symfony PHP projects

This is a blank [Symfony](http://symfony.com) project that will connect to any [prismic.io](https://prismic.io) repository. It uses the prismic.io PHP development kit, and provide a few helpers to integrate with the Symfony framework.

> This is a starter project, you are encouraged to use it to bootstrap your own project, or as inspiration to understand how you can integrate the prismic.io developement kit with a Symfony project.

### How to start?

    git clone git://github.com/prismicio/php-symfony-starter.git
    cd php-symfony-starter
    sudo chmod -R 777 app/cache app/logs
    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php --
    php composer.phar install

Launch the application in your browser (the URL should be something like http://localhost/php-symfony2-starter/web/app_dev.php/).

### Reporting an issue

Note that this starter project is almost entirely based on [the official prismic.io SymfonyBundle](https://github.com/prismicio/SymfonyBundle); please report any issue over there.
