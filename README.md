## Starter for Symfony PHP projects

This is a blank [Symfony](http://symfony.com) project that will connect to any [prismic.io](https://prismic.io) repository. It uses the prismic.io PHP developement kit, and provide a few helpers to integrate with the Symfony framework.

> This is a starter project, you are encouraged to use it to bootstrap your own project, or as inspiration to understand how you can integrate the prismic.io developement kit with a Symfony project.

### How to start?

Install the project into your Web server, and you will be automatically asked about correct repository point and client details required to connect with Prismic.

Launch the application in your browser (the URL should be something like: http://localhost/php-symfony2-starter/web/app_dev.php/).
